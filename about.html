                            <p>Joined my first competitive swim team at age 12 as a way to train to become a Lifeguard and Swim Instructor. As a young boy I was fascinated with lifesaving and the techniques involved as I progressed through all the swimming levels offered by the City of Burlington aquatics. Over the years, I mastered all four competitive strokes - freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly. I also became proficient in various water skills such as diving, flip turns, treading water and rescues. My experience competing at regional levels and with my high school gave me insights into performance psychology, goal setting, and the mental aspects of swimming that I now share with my students to help them overcome challenges and build confidence in the water.</p>

                            <p>Joined Scouts Canada as a Cub at age 10 with the 13th Burlington Group, quickly embracing its core values of community, honesty, resourcefulness, and compassion. The motto "Do Your Best" became a personal philosophy that still guides me today. Over the years, Scouting shaped my leadership and teamwork skills through outdoor adventures and service projects. At 13, I became our group's Chief Scout, leading camps and initiatives while earning the Chief Scout's Award‚Äîthe highest youth recognition at the Scout level. In Ventures, I stepped into a more strategic leadership role as Vice President and later President, organizing weekly meetings, planning events, and helping the group run smoothly. I also began mentoring younger Scouts‚Äîleading camps and passing down the same outdoor and leadership skills that had shaped my own journey. Supporting the next generation became one of the most rewarding parts of my time in Scouting. One of the highlights of my Scouting journey came in the summer of 2023, when I represented Canada at the World Scout Jamboree in South Korea. Joining thousands of youth from around the globe, I experienced an incredible exchange of cultures, ideas, and adventure. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that deepened my connection to the global Scouting community and reminded me how powerful shared values and teamwork can be‚Äîno matter where you're from.</p>

                            <p>In 2021, I earned my National Lifeguard certification from the Lifesaving Society and began working at Goldfish Swim School in Burlington. Drawing on my Scouts Canada experience, I helped toddlers and shy beginners feel comfortable and confident in the water. I also coached the Goldfish Swim Team, applying my competitive swimming background to strengthen technique, endurance, and speed in a performance-focused setting. Beyond instruction, I contributed to curriculum development by evaluating both swimmers and fellow instructors to help improve overall program quality. At the same time, I joined the City of Burlington as an Instructor Guard, having earned additional certifications in Lifesaving, Emergency First Aid with CPR-B, and Swim Instruction. Here, my focus shifted more toward water safety and drowning prevention, with a special emphasis on adult learners and the Junior Lifeguard Club. Teaching adults with limited swim experience and goals sharpened my communication skills and taught me to adapt my approach to varied learning styles. With the Junior Lifeguard Club, I mentored aspiring teens by running drills in swimming, first aid, rescues, and underwater skills. I also shared my personal experience as a working lifeguard, giving them practical insights into real-world responsibilities and the mindset required to handle high-pressure situations. Balancing roles at both Goldfish and the City of Burlington gave me wide-ranging experience in teaching across ages, skill levels, and goals‚Äîsolidifying my strengths in instruction, mentorship, and aquatic leadership.</p>

                        <div class="expanded-content">
                            <p>In September 2023, I began my Engineering journey at the University of Western Ontario in London. Like many students stepping into a rigorous program, I felt unsure wondering if this was the right fit and whether I could rise to the challenge. First year was a mix of adjustment and discovery. From moving away from home and living independently for the first time, to navigating labs, tutorials, quizzes, and exams, every part of the experience was new. But through the uncertainty, I leaned on my resilience, curiosity, and work ethic. The very qualities I had developed through years of leadership and teaching. I embraced opportunities to connect with others, joined campus clubs, and pushed through the steep learning curve that comes with a demanding academic environment. By the end of the year, I successfully completed my foundational courses and chose to specialize in Mechanical and AI Systems Engineering, excited by the intersection of physical systems and intelligent design. Inspired by the guidance and support I received from my own Residence Don in first year, I applied for the position myself and was selected to serve during my second year. Leading a floor of first-year engineering students was both a challenge and a privilege. As a Don, I became a mentor offering academic support, helping students adapt to the demands of university life, and fostering a community where new students could feel connected. It was a way for me to pay forward the mentorship I had received, while growing as a leader and communicator in a whole new environment.</p>
